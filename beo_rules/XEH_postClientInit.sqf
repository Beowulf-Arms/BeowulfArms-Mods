- <b>Donâ€™t be a dick<b/> - If you have to stop and think about it, you are probably being a dick.
<br /><br />
- As a primarily ArmA tactical realism community, we count upon our players having a high level of maturity as expected from the rest of the ArmA community.
<br /><br />
- Respect your fellow players, treat people as you would wish to be treated.
<br /><br />
- Beowulf as a community will not tolerate warez, bullying, racism or any other kind of antisocial / illegal or generally unacceptable behaviour within the community.
<br /><br />
- For the ease of communication, only English shall be used during sessions.
<br /><br />
- The use of third party (unapproved) scripts and mods on any Beowulf server is strictly prohibited and may result in permanent banning. 
<br /><br />
- Do not do anything in a game session which might disrupt or ruin the experience for other players. For example: (deliberate) team killing, spoiling surprises etc. 
<br /><br />
- These are just general guidelines, the Beowulf admin team can (and will) act as they see fit for the benefit of the community.
<br /><br />
- <b>If in doubt, refer to rule 1.<b>
